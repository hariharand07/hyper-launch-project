# hyper-launch-project

This project aims to develop a Python-based application that performs data analysis and prediction on a grocery inventory dataset using supervised machine learning. The application focuses on forecasting product sales (Sales_Volume) based on various inventory-related features such as stock quantity, reorder levels, supplier details, and product categories.

The data set has been taken from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/grocery-inventory)

The motivation behind this application is to help grocery store managers make smarter inventory decisions by identifying high-demand products, underperforming suppliers, and optimal restocking strategies. By applying a regression model (e.g., Random Forest), the application can predict future sales volumes and generate actionable insights that enhance inventory management.
